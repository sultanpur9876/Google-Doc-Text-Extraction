At Rubico we want to promote a healthy software development that welcomes a retrospective evaluation of the progress or the end product. </p><p>The process for the retrospective meetings will be as follows:  </p><ol><li>During the pre-development of the project, the PC creates a timeline/Sprint/Due Dates for the project that includes dates for retrospective meetings for which the participants should include Client, RM and PC. </li><li>The meeting should be chaired by the RM, who can use the <a href="https://forms.gle/Tavu9E1uKZqZNNZd9">Project Feedback Form</a> as reference to ask the questions to the Client and may fill out the form on behalf of the Client. </li><li>The <a href="https://forms.gle/Tavu9E1uKZqZNNZd9">Project Feedback Form</a> can also be shared with the Client prior to the meeting and if the data has been submitted by the Client already, the RM should consider addressing only matters that were not cleared from the details the Client filled out. </li><li>The Survey should be shared with the Client according to the PC’s timeline. It is recommended for the PC to request the Client to fill up the survey at the end of one of the scheduled calls with the team. This will help us collect more inputs from the Clients. If the Client is unwilling to do it while on the call, you may share the link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-8bUD0uHJqa6LmK6Yo1_lB4oDWB6Yb9iZHe82N_mhNwrSzA/viewform">Project Feedback Form</a> through Zoom Chat and/or the Master Doc.</li></ol><p>Retrospective meetings can be planned based on below project criteria:<br /></p><ol><li>For large complex projects with a probable timeline and where the planned sprints are already in progress, these meetings can be scheduled after reaching a Milestone delivery.<br /></li><li>For ongoing projects without an end insight (maintenance, task based projects) these meetings can be scheduled periodically every 2 to 3 months. <br /></li><li>For Projects with a defined deadline or short (1-12 weeks), these meetings can be scheduled at the end of the project as it should follow the principle of giving enough time for the Client to assess the relationship and the work. <br /></li><li>For Sprint based projects, the retrospective meeting should be scheduled after every EVEN NUMBER SPRINT (e.g. Sprint #2, Sprint #4, etc.).</li></ol><p>Add the retrospective scheduled meetings in the Timeline/Sprint Plan or create a schedule for the meetings and add it to the timeline column of OPPM.</p><h2><a id="_xsjlnoue6pcz"></a>Step 7: Development</h2><p>After the initial requirements are understood and clear to the team, the development begins. Development can include Graphic/UI design, SEO, and actual coding. It is important that the PC takes an approval on project Spec Doc from the Client before development starts.</p><p><strong>Daily Standup Meeting</strong></p><p>Daily Standup Meeting is an internal 15 minute meeting where no one is allowed to sit on a chair! The Client is normally not invited to the meeting.</p><p><strong>3 Questions that each Team member answers:</strong></p><ol><li>What did I accomplish since the last Standup meeting?</li><li>What do I plan to do by the next Standup meeting?</li><li>What challenges am I facing?</li></ol><p>The Standup meeting is not a problem-solving meeting. When a major challenge is reported that needs discussion, a separate meeting should be scheduled. It is possible to convert a morning Standup meeting into a problem-solving meeting, with prior notification to the team.</p><h2><a id="_dtn2d3ozd6a1"></a>Step 8: Testing</h2><p>Here are the steps recommended to be followed by the team for Testing process:</p><ol><li>After completing the development and unit testing on the development environment, the Development Team should update the staging environment. </li><li>The staging environment then needs to be tested or reviewed at least once by the Development Team before updating the QA team.</li><li>Once the Development Team confirms that the staging environment is ready for review and internal testing, QA should start the testing process making sure that the issues or feedback are documented fully on the gitea or any bug reporting platform for that case.</li><li>It is advisable to add proper screenshots or gif supporting the issue reported so that it is easier for the Development Team to reproduce and fix quality issues quickly.</li><li>Once all the feedback or issues are reported, QA should update the Development Team to start fixing the issue.</li><li>The Development Team is advised not to fix any issues during the testing phase.</li><li>Once the issues are resolved and marked as resolved on the gitea. The Development Team will ask the QA to do a regression testing.</li><li>The QA team will then do the regression testing and confirm that no pending issues are there.</li><li>PC will then ask the Development Team to schedule a demo meeting with the whole team so that the whole team can review the product and provide feedback.</li><li>This meeting should take place at least one day prior to the Client’s meeting. So that the Development Team can work on the fixes in case any are reported during the demo.</li><li>PC then makes the final call to either reschedule the Client meeting in case there are major issues or attend the scheduled meeting and deliver the final staging product to the Client.</li><li>Once delivered the testing process will be marked as completed and the team can wait for the UAT to finish before working on the feedback in case reported by the Client.</li></ol><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <a href="#_qs5hxxwz1m9c">Device Management</a></p><h2><a id="_2ehwxlcknhva"></a>Step 9: UAT &amp; Release</h2><p>Whenever the QA team finalizes their testing and all the Club tasks and tickets from Gitea/BugHerd are closed (which are required for this release) then the PC should arrange the Staging UAT/sheet with the Client.</p><p>After the UAT, the PC should work with the release person and update the files into the production environment. A release person can be a Tech Point or PC or a third person out of the team.</p><p>Once release has been verified by the QA team on the Live environment, the PC should arrange Live UAT with the Client.</p><p>During the Live Environment launch, the PC should assemble all the team, the PC should invite all the members who he/she believes are critical for this step. </p><h3><a id="_u0l41po87286"></a>UAT FAQs</h3><p><strong>What is UAT?</strong></p><p>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is an exercise performed by the Product Owner to verify and accept the project before moving it to the production environment and after moving to production. </p><p><strong>Why do we do UAT?</strong></p><p>Developers code software based on their &quot;own&quot; understanding of the requirements and may not actually be what the Product Owner expects from the software. Also, requirements change during the course of a project and may have been missed by team members.</p><p><strong>How long should UAT take?</strong></p><p>The PO should start UAT immediately after being informed by the PC. For reference, consider this: For small projects ~200-500 hrs, the UAT may take a day. For larger projects ~500+ hrs, it may take more days. But it also depends on the requirement provided by the Client. </p><p><strong>When should UAT be done?</strong></p><p>It is done twice. UAT is done as the last step before moving to production and the first step after going into production.</p><p><strong>What are the steps involved in UAT?</strong></p><p>PC along with the QA engineer and Tech Point decide on the appropriate UAT process. The typical process is:</p><ul><li>The QA Engineer defines the appropriate test scenarios and documents them on the UAT sheet (or equivalent).</li><li>PC notifies PO to do UAT on the staging.</li><li>PC notifies the PO about the updated tally of the Hours up to the beginning of UAT. </li><li>After PO completes the staging UAT the product is moved to production.</li><li>The PO completes the production UAT immediately.</li></ul><p><strong>Which tools should be used in UAT?</strong></p><p>The following are the common tools used:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FknRI9kW83jtMpiqZ3gdIAbtXGJn_b_7FLEnUwZazKs/edit#gid=14161040">UAT sheet</a></li><li>BugHerd</li><li>Gitea</li><li>PM Tool</li></ul><p><strong>When to use a Release Note? </strong></p><p>When a Client requires a release note document, the team can use<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sURzqKLhb6R3skFiQKLFgTEp9qN2XCN2EblWjIZ23pM/edit#heading=h.7nizfkzxnaj"> this template</a>.

This gives the team most of the day to test the application on the live server before the Client and users review the system. If you are not able to do it on Monday, no need to delay it for another week, it is recommended you can also go live on Tuesday or Wednesday... </p><p><strong>What should I consider for a Go-Live event? </strong></p><p>At the time of a scheduled Go-Live event for any website, the relevant team members needs to be present in the office and if in case a person, including network/server, developer, QA, etc. has a planned leave, an additional person (most likely the Tech point/Developer/network/server) should be made responsible to take on the responsibilities of the person on leave. </p><p><strong>Who is responsible for creating the Go-Live event?</strong></p><p>The PC is responsible for creating the Go-Live meeting on the calendar and inviting the network/server person as well as the other relevant members.</p><p><strong>When should the PC Schedule the Go-Live event? </strong></p><p>It should be created a minimum of 24 hours in advance. 48 hours is ideal as this will allow members to also join the last stand up meeting a day before the Go-live.</p><p><strong>What is the role of the Network/Server Team member in the Go-Live event? </strong></p><p>The Network person is responsible to add more project specific points to the network checklist (e.g. hosting, DNS and third party credentials can be added as a checkpoint) before the Go-Live event and should be referred to at the time of Go-Live event.</p><p><strong>Who will make the project live?</strong></p><p>Web-based projects</p><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>Only one member of the Server team, with the help of the developers.

They help in tracking progress, aligning team efforts, and managing deadlines.</p><p>However, not all projects may use milestones. For instance, in very small or simple projects, or in projects using agile methodologies where work is iterative and continuous, milestones might be less formal or even unnecessary.</p><p>Some examples of Project Milestone can be:</p><ul><li>Requirements Completed</li><li>Designs Approved</li><li>Completion of an MVP</li><li>Project Closure</li></ul><p><strong>If the Client is making the site live, when does the Milestone apply?</strong></p><ul><li>When there is no backlog of work and we want to release team members to other projects </li><li>When the current Phase for the project is completed and the Client agrees to the backlog of work is for an additional Phase</li><li>When the site is not live after five business days and Rubico has communicated with the Client about the lack of backlog work, once they acknowledge the lack, the team will then be released<br /></li></ul><p><strong>Is the Milestone Achieved when the Client stops communicating during the UAT? </strong></p><p>No, but the PC can send an email to notify the Client that the project will be put on hold and the team will be assigned to other projects until Rubico receives a written confirmation from the Client to restart with the project. </p><h2><a id="_ud1r9s1rmdku"></a>Step 11: Billing</h2><ul><li>The PC will make sure that all work has been completed, is well tested and the client is reasonably satisfied.</li><li>PC is responsible to properly account for all billable hours.

If a client refers to such email being sent to a PC or the team,  the PC should direct the client to communicate with the RM who has the visibility and can further assist the client. </li></ul><h2><a id="_qodrdarkihdu"></a>Step 12: Sharing the Code/Spec Doc</h2><p><strong>For projects where Rubico is Hosting: </strong></p><p>The PC should always confirm with the RM that the invoices are up-to-date before sharing the code. Code can only be shared with the Client if invoices are paid.</p><ul><li><strong>Special Cases </strong><ol><li><strong>Client/Team with Technical Skills: </strong></li></ol></li><li>Ask the Client to create a repository <ul><li>Share access with Rubico Team</li><li>Share the code in their repository</li></ul></li><li>Include Client in our Repository<ul><li>Client’s access should be limited to the specific project repository.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Client does not have/need version control </strong></li></ol></li><li>Share through Google Drive</li><li>Share through a password protected Zip file </li></ul><p><strong>For projects where Client is Hosting: </strong></p><p>RM should try to get these Clients into a prepaid committed agreement, and PCs can confirm with RM if this is a prepaid Client.</p><p><strong>When Client is a committed Client</strong></p><p>When requested by the Client, the team may share the code using the above special cases considerations. </p><p><strong>SpecDoc</strong> </p><ol><li>Maintenance/task based projects also need to be made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZEqAL19shShtNmWG1PlgCpjWAuG0w4_U1axS5Xc3gA/edit?usp=sharing">SpecDoc</a>.

It is a worksheet used by the team to assess the success of the project, identify best practices for future projects, resolve all open issues, and formally close the project’s milestone.</p><p><br />The Project Coordinator should create this document at the beginning of the project and share it with all the team members and review the project with the team once it is completed. To do this PC schedules a meeting with all the participants as listed on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JzfhZHlnJLjhMVv_t2pBlIPxJ82vW3-Yn326SUqe2UU/edit">Project Review Report</a> document to review the project once it is completed.</p><p><strong>Project PRE-Review Report </strong></p><ul><li>Clean up Final Tasks<ul><li>Confirm outstanding issues, risks, and recommendations</li><li>Outline tasks and activities required to close the project</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Project Review Report </strong></p><p>This Project Review Report is created to accomplish the following goals:</p><ul><li>Celebrate &amp; Encouragement (assuming the project was successful!)<ul><li>Encourage the team in the areas where the project was successful (Quality, Budget, Timeline)</li><li>This meeting should be a time for people to express themselves about how they feel about the project and what they learned</li></ul></li><li>Continual Improvement<ul><li>Review and validate the success of the project</li><li>Identify project highlights and best practices for future projects</li></ul></li></ul><p>After the Review Report meeting is completed then it will be moved to the “Completed Projects” tab on the OPPM.<strong> </strong>PCs should review with OPPM and update Club at the same time as it moves from the HDR/DDN tab to the Completed tab in OPPM.</p><p><strong>Timing of the Meeting</strong></p><p>Project Reviews are meant to be &quot;special&quot; and encouraging times for the team therefore the meeting times should be during regular office hours. The meeting should be kept as short as possible (30 minutes or less) at the end of project completion and for ongoing/maintenance projects at least once a year. There is no need to review every single item on the doc as everyone should have reviewed it before the meeting.  Discussion should revolve around people stating what they learned etc….  </p><p><strong>Token of Appreciation</strong></p><p>Chocolates may be given at the beginning of the meeting if the project was deemed successful. PC should ensure that this is available and distributed appropriately.</p><p>[OPTIONAL] If a RM cannot attend the Review Report meeting during India office hours then</p><ul><li>The PC can record the meeting or have a separate meeting with the RM before and the PC can deliver your thoughts to the team. </li><li>The RM can also be encouraged to record themselves on video and the team can watch it during the meeting.</li></ul><h2><a id="_rbpsyltgs4o4"></a>Step 14: Support and Maintenance</h2><p>Considering the nature of the Client and their project, the PC should communicate with RM if a <strong>Maintenance and Support Proposal </strong>should be given.</p><p>A Client may just need a few updates and will only require Rubico to be engaged with occasional changes/fixes, this is considered an “inactive” client and the team should support the Client according to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ODvn3X_3FS8v7uhswk2hOnZY-BzVGvgK1Y1MXR2a1_o/edit#heading=h.al2k7q4jti2j">SLA</a>. </p><p>If the Client will require consistent support to work, the PC should collaborate with the RM to define a FTE proposal that best suits the Client needs. This could be considered when Client has a need and budget to support at minimum of 20 hrs/month of engagement. </p><p>To help you in making a decision to propose a maintenance engagement use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wen1BaoFjR0dOA2Fz3lqR30K0hxRwEArXkqWDF_H_9I/edit">Application Support Questionnaire Template</a> (ASQ) for collaborating effectively with the Client. </p><h1><a id="_z7zst4z0xgou"></a>OPPM Sheet</h1><h1><a id="_zeyifybnihxy"></a><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR4XmP4//8/AwAI/AL+GwXmLwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" /></h1><p>Everyone has edit rights on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kBb5EbvCSWjRLcDLu3R0-oOgxbowTaEEg0BBijEIteI/edit#gid=1368702071">OPPM</a> sheet for their respective column.

For resources with less than two years of experience, allocating a resource to a single project with at least 4 hours of daily involvement can help them develop deep expertise and prevent them from feeling overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities.</p><p>For resources with 2 to 4 years of experience, project coordinators are encouraged to use discretion based on the individual’s technical skills and efficiency growth. While it may be beneficial to keep them focused on a single project, flexibility should be allowed if the resource is ready to take on additional responsibilities or if other projects require their support for further development.</p><h1><a id="_p3cs72dd4fjk"></a>Club</h1><p>Club is our Project Management Tool/Software.

The Daily Report shows all the hours logged in Club on projects or WFH. If an employee misses to update the Club log by 11:30 am the report will not have the information about the last day's work. In this case the Employee should immediately:</p><ul><li>Log their time </li><li>Send an email to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DVDyufrFlFtdlspaqPOFkU_FWgRHFUNLh5NYgiQBSXs/edit#heading=h.swpv01j8jesm">Office Admin</a> to help them understand the situation</li></ul><p>An employee should only log the time that they actually worked. SLs or Leaves should be availed in case less than 8 hours was worked.</p><p>If an employee does not meet these expectations, then their WFH privilege will be canceled.</p><p><strong>WFH Club logs must be detailed</strong></p><p>If the person working from home does not give proper description to a WFH task then it will not be considered and this time will be counted as a leave.

Unless otherwise specified, there is an administrative service fee of 15% (or a minimum of $5) for these “materials”. Examples of third party purchases include SSL certificates, plugins, themes, extensions, servers, stock photos/artwork, etc. To request such purchases email <a href="mailto:billing@rubicotech.com">billing@rubicotech.com</a>. Use the Timesheet App to record the purchased item. It will automatically apply the service fee by default.</p><h2><a id="_th3612elsbs"></a>Exporting Billing</h2><p><strong>1st working day of the month</strong> - developers review and finalize all hours from the previous month. Ideally they should only be logging hours from the last day of the previous month.</p><p><strong>2nd working day of the month</strong> - PCs review the hours in Club then import the hours into the Timesheet App. After the hours are imported, click the “Send report” button to email the Client  (and CC’ed to PC and RM) a copy of the hours. This ensures there are no surprises when they get their invoice a few days later.</p><h3><a id="_fcyqqwpkra87"></a><em>Step-by-step billing process:</em></h3><ol><li>Review hours in Club (weekly!)</li><li>Go from Club to timesheet dashboard and import hours from Club using the “Import timesheet” button - this brings it to public/Client visibility for weekly communication purposes (weekly!)</li><li>In the timesheet go to a particular project and import monthly hours into the billing sheet- this will be reviewed by Indian and US Admin and an invoice will be sent. This is done monthly as early as possible, but no later than 2nd.</li><li>Ensure that Club hours match Time App hours by reviewing them from the Billing Sheet option in the left menu of the Timesheet.<ol><li>If anything is not to be billed to the Client, please mark them non-billable from Club.</li><li>In case, there is an update to be shared with the billing team regarding expenses or credit card use (for testing), add a note using the “i” button. This will notify billing about extra expenses for that month.</li></ol></li><li>Once the hours match the Timesheet and Club, mark the checkbox. </li><li>To notify the Client about the monthly hours use the “Send Report” button. This must be done at the end of the month once the hours are final.</li></ol><p><strong>3rd working day of the month</strong> - Alan Anil and Steve Surya audit project billing from each PC and approve them in the Timesheet App billing dashboard and then inform Brandon George for Rubico US to invoice the Clients.</p><p>Projects can have the following category of projects as per different milestones in the project lifecycle like:</p><p><strong>Active</strong> - Team is actively engaged in a project and has regular meetings with the Client. Hours are rounded to the nearest 0.25 hour (15 minutes). Client is a <a href="#_r0bzi45xt4k5">High Volume</a> Client.</p><p><strong>Maintenance</strong> - Team is supporting the Client and working on small tasks and does not have regular meetings with Client. Hours are rounded to the nearest 0.5 hour (30 minutes) with a minimum of 1 hour per day billed. Client is a <a href="#_r0bzi45xt4k5">Low Volume</a> Client.</p><p>We charge a higher rate to many of our Clients after the project lifecycle ends and we start doing ad-hoc maintenance tasks (small tasks).</p><p><strong>Monthly</strong> - We have a committed agreement (retainer) where Client is paying us monthly for supporting their project(s). We do not have regular meetings with the Client, but do have regular work.</p><p>Each project also has different types of tasks which we can classify as following:</p><p><strong>Task Billable - </strong>This is for fixed cost tasks.</p><p><strong>Log Billable Tasks - </strong>The billable hours for each feature should be verified by the PC in Club</p><p>You can check the billing hours of your project/tasks in Club: </p><p><a href="https://club.rubico.tech/reports/assignments">https://club.rubico.tech/reports/assignments</a></p><p>If you are not able to find the hours you want to bill in this month in the Timesheet App then please discuss with Alan Anil and Steve Surya</p><p>Note: Whenever our project is 'over' and we don't have any weekly meetings with them anymore, then we need to inform billing@RubicoTech.com so any small tasks we spend from that point onward are billed at the higher hourly rate and project status will be “Maintenance”.</p><h3><a id="_8qispemve5ws"></a>Managing the TimeApp</h3><p>All PC’s are required to update the Timesheet/TimeApp at least one time per week for their projects and discuss the same with the Client during the weekly meeting as an Agenda point in the Project Master document.</p><h3><a id="_w0ztzqwgt1sy"></a>Managing the Deposit</h3><p><strong>Why does Rubico collect a deposit from Clients?</strong></p><ul><li>Rubico collects a deposit from a new Client so we have some kind of assurance of the Client’s ability to pay for our services. The Deposit is normally equivalent to 4 weeks of the expected burn rate (e.g @30 hrs/ week the total burn rate will be 120 hours). </li><li>Case 1 - Non-phase approach<ul><li>We will collect the ~4 weeks deposit upfront based on the burn rate</li><li>In the event that the burn rate increases, Rubico may increase the deposit proportionately. </li></ul></li><li>Case 2 - Phase-wise approach<ul><li>Phase 1 (Discovery/Wireframing/Design)<ul><li>First Invoice 30 hrs refundable deposit</li></ul></li><li>Phase 2<ul><li>Burn rate @30 hrs / week </li><li>Second Invoice will collect a deposit of 90 hours (120 hours minus 30 hours)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Discovery/Wireframing/Design Phase Refundable Deposit<ul><li>Rubico requires an initial deposit of ~15-30 hours to initiate resources. This deposit will be credited or refunded back after all work is completed.</li></ul></li><li>For existing projects where the Refundable Deposit was agreed in different terms, the PC can reach out to the Finance Admin to determine how to proceed.</li></ul><p><strong>How does the Deposit get added to the Timesheet/TimeApp</strong></p><ul><li>The PC needs to record the deposit hours in the Timesheet App using the Deposit feature.</li><li>The amount of hours taken as a deposit can be found in the Team Composition email.</li></ul><p><strong>When should the Deposit be returned (e.g. returned to the Client)?</strong></p><ul><li>The RM and Finance Admin will manage the return of the deposit to the Client.</li><li>The deposit will be returned when the Client requests it or after 6-12 months of no work.<ul><li>If the PC receives a request from Client, they should forward the request to the RM so that he can manage with the Finance Admin the return of the same.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a id="_m450ysvf61qf"></a>Additional Project Billing and Payment</h3><p>PC will make sure that the hours added by the employee in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ISdh3IR8urftmE1B1noAotjZnbGGmXMIUAWn25m_psY/edit#gid=363507542">Extra Project Timesheet</a> are added in Club as well and are exported to their monthly Billing sheet.</p><p>PC will provide their approval on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ISdh3IR8urftmE1B1noAotjZnbGGmXMIUAWn25m_psY/edit#gid=363507542">Extra Project Timesheet</a> if Rubico should pay to the employee.</p><p>Kevin Kundan will make sure to put the hours in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13J5BSHzd5lSrGIrWDrtQmCHc0pTCnXB46p4FC3QmsII/edit#gid=974184366">compiled sheet</a> for the Payroll Admin and will leave a comment for the Payroll Admin to discuss with the Operations Director and pay to the employee.</p><h2><a id="_r0bzi45xt4k5"></a>Rounding Hours</h2><p>Two types of Clients: </p><ol><li>High Volume Clients give significant hours regularly</li><li>Low Volume Clients give only a few hours sporadically</li></ol><p>If it is unknown the type of Client, then ask the PC.</p><p><strong>High Volume Clients</strong></p><p>Round up to the nearest 15 minutes (minimum of .25 hour). This category also includes Clients with a signed Monthly Maintenance contract for Project work.c</p><p><strong>Low Volume Clients</strong></p><p>Round up to the nearest 30 minutes. (minimum of 1 hour). This helps to compensate for the time spent in billing, etc.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><p>We have a Client and we complete their website development work. Now Client wants us to update their site when required. </p><p>On 1st of January the Client has given some photos to add to their website and the following people spent time on this task:</p><ul><li>PC spent 15 minutes</li><li>Graphic Designer spent 15 minutes</li><li>Software Engineer spent 15 minutes</li></ul><p>The next day Client gave the PC a link to add on the homepage which the PC did himself which took 15 minutes.</p><p><strong>How many Hours do we Bill?  Answer is 2 hours.</strong></p><p>Client has given us two different tasks at two different times. In such a case we will bill one hour for each log (total 2 hours).</p><p>If the Client would have sent us both tasks at the same time (we get this work together in one day), then we would only bill one hour.</p><h2><a id="_k5bad8qkr4ff"></a>Billable Hours (Client’s Perspective)</h2><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR4XmP4//8/AwAI/AL+GwXmLwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" /></p><p><strong>Must Deliver Value</strong> (not just a timesheet)</p><p>Billable hours are not equal to Actual Hours.  Billable hours are equal to the actual hours of time spent providing <strong>value </strong>to the project (Client). Time a person spends building their skills/training/attending non-project meetings, etc are not billable.</p><p><strong>Experienced vs Inexperienced Developers</strong></p><p>Less experienced developers can only provide 50-75% billable time (4 to 6 hours per day).  More experienced developers normally can give 7-8 billable hours per day. Normally, it is expected that for 16 hours/day of billable PHP development there will be more than 2 developers actively involved in the project in order to cover for one another’s deficiencies and leaves.</p><p><strong>India vs USA Development Time</strong></p><p>A Client needs to experience that 1 billable hour from India is similar to 1 billable hour from a programmer in the USA. A common concern from USA Clients is that India programming can take significantly more time than a local USA programmer. We need to make sure that there is not a significant gap in the difference. Reasons for the gap include: cross-cultural communication, English as a second language, lack of USA industry knowledge, lack of understanding of western social dynamics, etc.</p><p><strong>Change of Resource</strong></p><p>It is also assumed that there will not be a change of Resource on the project without the knowledge of the Client. The Client does not expect to pay for training/ramping up a new Developer if there is a need for a developer to leave the project. Any changes in HR need to be discussed transparently with the Client.</p><h1><a id="_gxpsve8bqw1g"></a>Client Management</h1><h2><a id="_nuk014jx7w2q"></a>Customer Support</h2><h3><a id="_w7w8tid2x1fs"></a>PC escalation to RM</h3><p>If you need support from RM in communicating your challenges/information to Client, here is a link for <a href="#_w7w8tid2x1fs">sample emails</a> you can use.</p><h3><a id="_a4xrsepj3ms5"></a>Best Practices for Relationship Managers (RM) [copied from Gold Book]</h3><ol><li>Continue to ask Client for Feedback<ol><li>Whether good or bad, please ask the Client if they have expressed this before to the PC.</li><li>Always think the best of the India team ...hold off judgment until you have “both” sides of the story.</li><li>If you believe things may not be going very well, then first talk to the PC and ask them “What do you think the Client will tell me when I ask them how the project is going?”.

Sometimes our Clients face critical issues with their applications or the website we developed for them. They expect us to assist them 24/7 for emergencies. </p><p>Rubico does not want to disturb the employees between 12 Midnight to 8am IST, however in case of mission critical issues Rubico expects everyone to be reachable on their mobile 24/7. In case we are not able to connect with your personal phone we will connect with you on your local secondary number added to the <a href="https://ep.rubico.tech/workTime">Rubico Work Time</a>. The first point of contact is always the <strong>Project Coordinator</strong>. If the Client is unable to reach the Project Coordinator, then the secondary person is the <strong>Relationship Manager</strong> (RM) followed by any other people mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IqKg14HBCKIaa88_EYiOHfz9NECIdLu0rB3ki6vWyEo/edit#heading=h.yr39svz39j16">Rubico Support Contact Info document</a>.</p><h3><a id="_ulpkhnifygqd"></a>Winning Back the Trust of the Client</h3><p><strong>Be Quick to Apologize</strong></p><p>The sooner you write an apology after an issue is discovered the better. Acting quickly can make the difference between saving or ending a business relationship.  However, if the incident in question may result in legal or financial loss, it is best first to bring this to the attention of the RM before sending.</p><p><strong>What to Include in Your Apology</strong></p><p>Usually, if you acknowledge you've made an error in judgment or were wrong in some fashion and express your regret sincerely, the person receiving the email will forgive the infraction and continue to do business with you. However, sometimes it takes more than words, and an apology must be accompanied by appropriate restitution to repair your business relationship.</p><p>Start by saying you are sorry. You want the intent of the letter to be clear. Next, offer an explanation regarding the reason for the letter. Acknowledge what went wrong and how you plan to rectify the situation. Along with extending the apology in a timely manner, be sure to promise you won't repeat the offense. At the end of the email, apologize one more time and mention you value the business relationship.</p><p><strong>Tips:</strong></p><ul><li>Write from your Heart!<ul><li>Don't just grab a letter from a template and use it.

In such cases we serve our Clients (web companies) as a Vendor by developing the Website/Application for their End Clients (3rd Party Clients for us).</p><p>Following are some protocols that we follow while working with such Third Party Clients:</p><ul><li>Do not communicate directly with Third Party Clients (End Client) by any means (Email, voice etc...) unless it has been requested by our Client</li><li>Do not use our Brand name (Rubico) on anything (email being sent from server, staging or production site, etc.) as these may be shared with Third Party Clients.</li><li>Do not put any reference to Rubico in code anywhere</li></ul><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR4XmP4//8/AwAI/AL+GwXmLwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" /></p><p><a href="https://app.diagrams.net/?libs=general;basic;arrows&amp;mode=google#G1HkkYedtMVbtuQa3h12kbCmBSVGM7HAox#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22qJO_R5SWqIUeQuRJz7u9%22%7D">Flowchart Edit</a></p><h3><a id="_ihi7zq4yzk0"></a>Don’t Leave a Digital Footprint when Working on 3rd Party Projects</h3><p>Please check in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1km8Lvwmj2u3E6pqTnMpYIhISjgQ4rc2P9iLmx27aq6o/edit#heading=h.4ygwjmgrfpf3">Purple Book</a> for more details.</p><h2><a id="_1jtqsl72cgcz"></a>Common Challenges</h2><h3><a id="_ao4gjmlyysrs"></a>Unresponsive Clients</h3><p>If the Client is unresponsive and delaying the project timeline, then the project is at serious risk. </p><p>Follow the below steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Empathize and Understand</strong><ol><li>Why is Client Delaying?: Talk with the Client and about what challenges they are facing in completing their tasks.. Tell them it’s delaying the timeline. Make sure they understand this.</li><li>Switch Shoes: Try to think about what challenges Client might be facing. Listen to them carefully and try to think about a solution to their challenges. Talk to them about the pressures and constraints they are under. You’ll be more empathetic, you’ll have a better understanding of why they are perhaps not being as responsive as you’d like, and you may just learn some things that will help you add more value in the relationship.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Plan A: Try to sort it out yourself.</strong><ol><li>Get a commitment. Agree with the Client on a specific date that Client will complete their task(s) and update that on the Master Doc’s Target Dates.   <ol><li>For example: You asked Client to provide content, make sure you give them a due date on which they agreed upon to complete it. Send them a reminder and see if the plan works.</li></ol></li><li>If Client doesn’t meet the committed date, follow Plan B</li></ol></li><li><strong>Plan B: Get OPPM and RM involved.</strong> <ol><li>Notify the OPPM team by changing the color of the cell to Yellow (or Orange). The OPPM team may offer suggestions.</li><li>Have a meeting with RM, explain to them the whole situation. </li><li>Put the Project on Hold</li><li>Send an email to RM telling the Client, we are putting the project on ON-HOLD until the Clientuntil Client has time to do their task(s). See <a href="#_w7w8tid2x1fs">email sample </a></li></ol></li></ol><h3><a id="_9p3051ylzyda"></a>How Do You Deal with Multiple Product Owners (Point Person)?</h3><p>It is very important to have only one point person in every project in order to avoid multiple requests from the Client. This cuts down the confusion of multiple experts with different expectations from the team.  Scrum by definition states we should have ONE single Product Owner so there is a singular voice of priority from the Client end. </p><p><strong>As soon a PC finds out that there are multiple people participating as a Product Owner: </strong></p><ol><li><strong>Empathize &amp; Understand.</strong><ol><li>PC should report it as a major risk/challenge on the Master Project document.</li><li>Schedule the meeting with the Product Owners to make them understand the need of single Product Owner</li></ol></li><li><strong>Plan A: Try to sort it yourself.</strong><ol><li>Goal of the meeting:<ol><li>Tell the challenge, clarify the intent.</li><li>Review the role of Product Owner with the Client. Why do we need a single voice? What we are trying to resolve. </li></ol></li><li>Once the Product Owner understands the WHY, they can help participate in solving it. </li><li>Allow the Client to decide who that single Point of Contact (Product Owner) will be.</li><li>If the Client changes the PO:<ol><li>PO is responsible for KT</li><li>Client needs to provide additional cost to Rubico for KT time spent by Rubico Team.</li></ol></li><li>Agree in a written email with the Client about who is being chosen as a Product Owner.</li><li>So, as a solution there is one person to work with the team, one person to prioritize requirements and play the End User Voice role. If the above plan doesn’t work, follow Plan B</li></ol></li><li><strong>Plan B: Get OPPM and RM involved.</strong><ol><li>Notify the OPPM team by changing the color of the cell to yellow (or orange). The OPPM team may offer suggestions.</li><li>Have a meeting with the RM (and invite Stan as Optional), explain to them the whole situation.</li></ol></li></ol><h1><a id="_i2wxlgipmyil"></a>Communication Protocols</h1><h2><a id="_xu0mwmef3mbi"></a>Client Friendly Name</h2><p>Normally everyone needs a “Client friendly name” also referred to as an “Office Name”. Reasons for a Client Friendly name are:</p><ul><li>The Client can <strong>understand</strong> your name</li><li>The Client can <strong>pronounce</strong> your name</li><li>The Client can <strong>remember</strong> your name</li><li>A Client friendly name will make it easier for you to build a trustworthy relationship with the Client.</li></ul><h2><a id="_fatz8126w0al"></a>Profile Picture</h2><p>A good profile picture is a way to make a good first impression. A smiling, happy face is always likable. Research says that a happy face increases the likability of the person even more. So please work with HR to make sure you have a happy, smiling profile picture for yourself.</p><p>Make sure you use the HR approved profile picture across:</p><ul><li>Google Workspace</li><li>Email Signature</li><li>Zoom (should be always logged in so your image is visible on zoom calls)</li><li>Club</li><li>Slack</li><li>Github</li><li>Gitea</li><li>Invision </li><li>Lucid Charts, Moqups</li><li>Other PM systems ie Trello, Asana, JIRA etc (Create accounts using the Google Workspace official Rubico account)</li></ul><p>Employees should login through Gmail accounts wherever it is allowed so that the system can pick up the Google Workspace profile picture. In case it does not then manually update the profile picture. Please upload the same picture everywhere.</p><h2><a id="_2yncil1e203z"></a>Google Workspace, Zoom &amp; Other Profiles</h2><p>Everyone should update their Google Workspace, Zoom and other tools (Club, plan.io, active collab, Basecamp, etc...) profiles with proper information: </p><ul><li>A professional photo, as shared by the HR team</li><li>Use your Client Friendly Name (not your official Indian name)<ul><li>Example: Steve Surya (not Surya Prakash)</li></ul></li><li>Google Voice USA phone number (if you have one)</li><li>Mobile phone number</li><li>Proper Local Time Zone<ul><li>Delhi Time Zone IST (UTC/GMT +5:30 hours)</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Google Workspace, Zoom</strong></p><p>On the first day of joining, your Google Workspace and Zoom accounts will be set up via our admin control panel. Access to your accounts will be removed on a person’s last day. </p><p>Your Zoom name will be set up using your Client friendly name. Example: Steve.Surya (if it is available otherwise use Steve Surya or Surya.Steve, etc)</p><p>ATTENTION:</p><ol><li>Zoom profile should have your Rubico email address and mobile number listed</li><li>Everyone should have their profile pictures updated on Zoom, Club, Google Docs, and any Client-end PM tools (Basecamp, Trello, etc).</li></ol><h2><a id="_l8irnwetfl0q"></a>Brand Identity for Rubico</h2><p>See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nafTR1cQATNcjUfVbPIS_AgEWQEgnkRlqmKXPNOGD0M/edit#slide=id.g2c2bd705891_0_0">Rubico Brand Guide</a> for the correct usage of the logo, colors, style of imagery, iconography, typography, copywriting voice and tone, and illustration guidelines.

We should all work together to minimize distractions in the office. Because chat messages “pop up” immediately, they can be very distracting and disturbing of a person’s concentration. Therefore only URGENT communication should be given over Slack.  The table below prescribes the protocols in choosing which way to communicate with others in the office.</p><p><strong>When should you use Email? </strong></p><p>Rather than using email to collaborate or discuss topics, it is much more efficient and effective to use the PM tool or a Google doc. Email is for notifications, not collaboration. Send an Email if</p><ul><li>You want to notify others of about non-urgent but important information</li><li>You do not need a reply in less than 4 hours</li></ul><p><strong>When should you use Slack? </strong></p><p>Slack should only be used for time sensitive topics that are urgent and important. This way everyone understands that Slack messages should be reviewed in real-time and take priority over other communication sent via other mediums. Use Slack when your question or info is urgent and needs to be acted upon immediately.</p><p><strong>When should I use the PM Tool/Google Doc, etc?</strong></p><p>If the question or info is related to a project/task, add a comment at the relevant place like the Google Doc (SpecDoc, Master, etc.) or in the PM Tool.</p><p>The following table describes the best medium to use when communicating.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Email</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Club/</strong></p><p><strong>PM Tool</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Google Doc</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Screen-</strong></p><p><strong>cast</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Slack</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Zoom/ </strong></p><p><strong>Face to Face</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Broadcasting Info</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Notifications</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Simple Instructions</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Introductions</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Long Conversations</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Urgent Topics</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Complex Topics/ Instructions</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Emotional Topics</strong></p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p>X</p></th><th><p><strong>✔</strong></p></th></tr></thead></table><h2><a id="_qy64muqja10g"></a>Communicating Effectively</h2><p><strong>Speak in English</strong></p><p>Practice makes perfect.

The calculation for TAT for a process is defined from the beginning (or first step) in the process to the end (or last step or deliverable) in the process.

The “CC” field should be used sparingly. You should only CC people who have a need to stay in the know.</li><li><strong>Keep messages brief and to the point.</strong> Make your most important point first, then provide details if necessary. Make it clear at the beginning of the message why you are writing. </li><li><strong>Don’t discuss multiple subjects in a single message</strong>. If you need to discuss more than one subject, send multiple emails. This makes it easy to scan subject lines later to find the message you need. It also contributes to briefer e-mail messages and a greater likelihood of a response. Also, the more specific you can be about your subject heading, the better.</li><li><strong>Reply in a timely manner</strong>. E-mail doesn’t demand an instantaneous response. Responding once or twice a day is sufficient unless you are in sales, customer service, tech support, or some other field where a faster response is expected. Regardless, you must reply in a timely manner.</li><li><strong>Be mindful of your tone</strong>. Unlike face-to-face meetings or even phone calls, those who read your email messages don’t have the benefit of your pitch, tone, inflection, or other non-verbal cues. As a result, you need to be careful about your tone. Sarcasm is especially dangerous. If something gets “lost in translation,” you risk offending the other party. The more matter-of-fact you can be, the better.</li><li><strong>Don’t use email to criticize others</strong>. E-mail is a terrific way to commend someone or praise them. It is not an appropriate medium for criticism. Chances are, you will simply offend the other person, and they will miss your point. These kinds of conversations are usually better-handled face-to-face or, if necessary, over the phone.</li><li><strong>Don’t reply in anger.</strong> In the heat of the moment, I have written some brilliant replies. I have said things in writing that I would never have the guts to say face-to-face. This is precisely why you should never ever fire off an email in anger. They almost never serve their purpose or your long-term interests. They burn up relationships faster than just about anything you can do. </li><li><strong>Don’t overuse “reply to all.”</strong> This, of course, just adds more clutter to everyone’s already unwieldy inbox. Your default response should be to reply only to the sender. Before you reply to everyone, make sure that everyone needs to know.</li><li><strong>Don’t forward chain letters.</strong> If you feel you absolutely must pass it on, please make sure that it is valid information. </li><li><strong>Don’t “copy up” as a means of coercion.</strong> It’s one thing to copy someone’s boss as a courtesy. I do this whenever I am making an assignment to someone who is not a direct report.</li><li><strong>Don’t write in ALL CAPS.</strong> This is the digital equivalent of shouting. Besides, ALL CAPS are harder to read.</li><li><strong>Don’t send or forward emails containing libelous, defamatory, offensive, racist or obscene remarks.</strong> If you do so, you can put yourself or your company at risk. You could be sued for simply passing something along, even if you aren’t the original author.</li><li><strong>Remember that company email isn’t private.</strong> You have no legal protection. Anyone with sufficient authority or access can monitor your conversations on company-owned servers. </li><li><strong>Use a signature with your contact information.</strong> This is a courtesy for those receiving your messages. It also cuts down on email messages, since people don’t have to send a second or third email asking for your phone number or mailing address.</li><li><strong>Provide “if-then” options.</strong> Provide options to avoid the back and forth of single option messages. For example, “I can meet at 10:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. Will one of those times work? If not, would you please reply with three times that would work for you?”</li><li><strong>Use your spell-checker.</strong> If I misspell words, use bad grammar or punctuation, then it reflects negatively on me and my company. That’s why God gave us spell-checkers. Make sure yours is turned on.</li><li><strong>Re-read your email before you send it.</strong> It’s a good idea to re-read your messages and make sure that you are communicating clearly and observing good email etiquette.</li></ol><p>Reference:  <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/e-mail-etiquette-101.html">http://michaelhyatt.com/e-mail-etiquette-101.html</a></p><h1><a id="_f1tjsqh4lfju"></a>Collaboration Protocols</h1><h2><a id="_z0753yzcyo3y"></a>Scheduling and Time Management</h2><h3><a id="_c4wasohkaiko"></a>Recommended Calendar Management</h3><ul><li>Look at your Google calendar at least twice a day and accept or reject meeting invites as early as possible (not last minute).</li><li>Show more than one timezone (Settings&gt;Your current timezone:&gt;Additional timezone)<ul><li>Choose (GMT+5:30) India Standard Time<ul><li>Label: India</li></ul></li><li>Choose (GMT-4:00) Eastern Time <ul><li>Label: EST</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Sync it with your smartphone</li><li>Schedule all meetings on Google Calendar</li><li>Schedule meetings immediately (do not tell people you will send an invite to them later).</li><li>The modify calendar event feature should be enabled for one-on-one meetings:<ul><li>This is a feature to facilitate collaboration, it is advisable to modify one on one events when the scheduled time and day conflict with another event and the other person’s availability. </li></ul></li></ul><h4><a id="_wi5v8snxw79c"></a><strong>Calendar Sharing Matrix</strong></h4><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>all@RubicoTech.in</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>PC@RubicoTech.in</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>OPPM@RubicoTech.in</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>BD@RubicoTech.in</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>HR@RubicoTech.in</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Development Team </strong></p><p><strong>(SE, QA, UI/UX, Network/Server)</strong></p></th><th><p>free/busy</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>PCs / Tech Team </strong></p></th><th><p>free/busy</p></th><th><p>free/busy</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Support Team</strong></p><p><strong>(BD, HR, Admin)</strong></p></th><th><p>free/busy</p></th><th><p>N/A</p></th><th><p>N/A</p></th><th><p>N/A</p></th><th><p>All Details</p></th></tr></thead></table><p>Everyone in RubicoTech.com and RubicoTech.in should be able to see “free/busy” for each other.</p><h3><a id="_nan8cjw64wr"></a>Conference Room Management</h3><p>Watch the video for How to book a conference room?</p><table><thead><tr><th><p><a href="https://youtu.be/PhaQZ97Alf0">RubicoTech.in</a></p></th><th><p><a href="https://youtu.be/Lx-6gDxE4aM">RubicoTech.com</a></p></th></tr></thead></table><p>When to book a conference room?</p><ul><li>In case there is no need to use a presentation, we recommend you utilize common spaces. </li><li>When to book the smaller CRs?<ul><li>For 3 or fewer people</li></ul></li><li>When to use the bigger CRs?<ul><li>Client calls </li><li>Require monitor</li><li>Require whiteboard</li><li>The team size is 4 or more</li><li>Interviews</li></ul></li><li>For standup meetings, please prefer common areas or a standing CR.</li><li>CR can be booked for a maximum of 1.5 hours at a time.</li><li>In case you no longer require the CR or the meeting is rescheduled, delete or modify the event.</li></ul><p>When your meeting requires cross-office participation:</p><ul><li>The organizer must book the required CR in his/her office and</li><li>Depending on the number of participants from the other office, the organizer should also book an appropriate CR from the other office.</li></ul><p>* Feel free to reach out to G-suite admins for any help.</p><h3><a id="_sha8lay75j7e"></a>Vacation Management</h3><h4><a id="_tim8mc35d3qk"></a><strong>Vacation Responder</strong></h4><p>When a person is going on leave then he/she must communicate with the Client ahead of time that he/she will be on leave.

At least two weeks before the holiday, all ongoing project timelines, deliverables, and potential impacts of reduced availability should be reviewed with clients. PCs should clearly communicate any anticipated delays and set expectations regarding response times. Additionally, clients should be informed of alternative contacts or escalation points for any urgent issues during this period. This preparation ensures that our clients remain informed and supported, mitigating any disruptions to project progress while respecting our team members' holiday schedules</p><h3><a id="_l9ecq4x8rscr"></a>Scheduling Meetings</h3><p>All meetings (both internal and external with Clients) should be scheduled using Google Calendar. Make guest(s) “optional” if they are not required by selecting the image to the left of their name (it turns gray color after selecting).</p><p>If you receive a meeting invitation, you should answer the request promptly by choosing:</p><ul><li>Yes</li><li>Maybe</li><li>No (Its recommended to add a note in case of ‘No’ so that the organizer can plan the next step if any)</li></ul><p>Use the “<strong>Find a time</strong>” feature on Google Calendar to schedule a meeting at a time that is suitable for other invitees. You can see the availability of others on your same domain or whoever’s calendar is shared with you.</p><p>Attach relevant documents (like the Master doc) to all calendar events.</p><h3><a id="_yy92q4czjmaq"></a>Scheduling Meeting with Client</h3><p>Every meeting you have with the Client should have an agenda point agreeing on the next meeting day/time.

Depending on their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_time_zones_by_U.S._state">USA time zone</a>, morning is optimal for most Americans who are employees in a large company (who do not work from home).  Traditional American business hours are 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. The actual time at work often varies as some employees like to come early and others prefer to stay late. </p><p>Sometimes Clients may work from home and be OK with calls or Zoom interactions in the evenings USA time (or in rare cases the early mornings), but that should only be done at their preference.</p><h4><a id="_pednft4npewb"></a>When emailing Clients, please include their local time as well as the Indian time. (If you are unsure, you can get their city location off their website or ask the RM). Most customers are not familiar with Indian time zones and it adds extra burden for them to figure it out.

In certain parts of the United States a one-hour shift occurs at 2am local time, in spring the clock jumps forward to 3am DST and that day has 23 hours, whereas in autumn the clock jumps backward to 1am standard time, repeating that hour, and that day has 25 hours.

Information which we create and use must be stored somewhere other than just our computers. There are broadly two places we typically store information: Git and Google Drive.</p><h3><a id="_ij02czhn0jgl"></a>Git</h3><p>Software that is under development should be stored in Git.

Storing non-Google docs/sheets/slides in Google Drive takes up space, so try to keep your files in the native Google docs/sheets/slides format whenever possible.</p><h3><a id="_lr1qsfslxxmh"></a>Exceptionally Large Files</h3><p>For storing very large files, each office also has a Network Attached Storage device (NAS).

The device holder should be permanently placed on the device station and labeled with the exact name of the device.  Also, each device holder has a PVC card fixed on it which is used by the team to write their name.</p><p>Whenever a resource requires a device from the device station, that resource has to update his/her name (e.g. <strong>ARLAN</strong> ) on the PVC card before taking the device, and use the marker pen which is always present near the device station to write the name. if a marker pen is not present then the person taking the device  can connect to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DVDyufrFlFtdlspaqPOFkU_FWgRHFUNLh5NYgiQBSXs/edit">Office Assistant</a> and ask for the marker pen. DO NOT USE a permanent marker.

Each device should be placed in its specific place as per the label on the charging station. The charging cables for the devices are well installed behind the charging station with proper power supply. Team members are advised not to remove the cables from the charging station. We also have separate individual cables for both Android and IOS, which can be used by the team members whenever they require them for debugging purposes on mobile devices.</p><p>If any team member requires any of the devices, they simply have to mention their name on the charging station on the specific position of the device as per the label on the charging station. Once their work is complete with the device the team members have to put the device on the charging station on the position as per the label of the device. Also they have to put the device on charging whenever they put back the device on the charging station after completing their task.</p><p>If any of the team members requires cable for debugging purposes they should reach out to the responsible person of the cables and ask for the cable and register their name in the register created specifically for this purpose. Whenever they return the cable they can strike out their name from the register.</p><p><strong>Take Device Home<br /></strong>If someone needs devices for home (testing/development purpose), they need to send an email to the PC of the project, a member of the network team and Saahil Joshua/Seth Simarpreet (admin).

The Client is not so particular in the person(s) who are working on their project as much as the tasks to be completed properly and efficiently.</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><p><strong>Allocated Resources (AR)</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>FTE</strong></p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Team members</strong></p></th><th><p>Fixed</p><p>(individual persons are allocated 4 hours or 8 hours per day)</p></th><th><p>Changes</p><p>(team members may change depending on the skill set required to do the tasks)</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Engagement with Client</strong></p></th><th><p>Treated like an in-house employee</p></th><th><p>Treated as an independent contractor</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Management</strong></p></th><th><p>Client assigns tasks to individuals</p></th><th><p>Rubico assigns tasks to individuals</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Continued Training of the Employee</strong></p></th><th><p>Client’s responsibility</p></th><th><p>Rubico responsibility</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Typical Project Types</strong></p></th><th><p>Large complex projects</p></th><th><p>Smaller projects but in larger quantity</p></th></tr><tr><th><p><strong>Billing</strong></p></th><th><p>Billed per person</p><p>(each person is full time or half time)</p></th><th><p>Billed per hour </p><p>(with a minimum amount of hours of 80, 160, 240, or 360 per month)c</p></th></tr></thead></table><h3><a id="_n1ttjn3sx2i8"></a>Allocated Resources (AR) FAQs</h3><p><strong>How do we bill ARs? </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Basis:</strong> We bill for ARs by day (full or half).</li><li><strong>Leave:</strong> Billing is not reduced for planned leave (up to 2 days/month).</li></ul><p><strong>Do we reduce billing when an AR is on leave?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Substitute AR, additional output (testing, design, etc.), or work catch-up next month.</li><li><strong>Planned Leave:</strong> Ensure pending work is explained to another team member for smooth workflow.</li><li><strong>Unplanned Leave:</strong> Don't bill for substitute time (testing, project management, etc.).</li></ul><p><strong>Is an AR ever expected to work on Saturdays and join Rubico events?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Saturdays:</strong> ARs may work Saturdays to meet deadlines or attend mandatory Rubico events (CMS updates, project estimations, etc.).</li><li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Participation in Rubico events fosters growth and ultimately benefits clients.</li><li><strong>Client Communication:</strong> ARs should inform clients about Rubico events and their value for the project.</li></ul><p><strong>How to manage expectations on previous projects an AR was involved in and work keeps coming?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Small Tasks:</strong> ARs can handle small requests from past clients, potentially requiring weekend/extended hours.</li><li><strong>Large Tasks:</strong> ARs should perform knowledge transfer and act as a mentor/consultant to a new resource.</li></ul><p><strong>Does my scope of learning get limited if I am an AR, as my scope is limited to one Client, project and framework?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Personal Development:</strong> ARs are encouraged to dedicate time (a few hours/week) to learn new technologies.</li><li><strong>Client Consulting:</strong> ARs can recommend new technologies to improve project efficiency, but discussions with PC and team are required before client interaction.</li><li><strong>Variety:</strong> ARs seeking exposure to different technologies/clients can request a half-time AR role (discuss with PC &amp; RM).</li></ul><p><strong>How can an AR justify 8 hours of productivity, when the actual productive hours are around 6-7 hours in a day?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Expectation:</strong> ARs are expected to deliver full-time equivalent output.</li><li><strong>Individual Efficiency:</strong> Some ARs deliver full output in 6-7 hours due to experience, while others may require 10+ hours.</li><li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> <strong>Accepting and meeting deadlines for assigned tasks is crucial; work the necessary hours to deliver on time.<br /></strong></li></ul><h3><a id="_ww4tpt4b7dew"></a>AR FAQs (Extended Version) <em><br /></em></h3><ul><li>How do we bill ARs? <ol><li>We bill on days basis for each AR, you could have Full Day or Half a Day</li></ol></li><li>Do we reduce billing when an AR is on leave?<ol><li>No. The AR on average should be providing 160 hours per month of output which is approximately 20 working days. In the average month there are 22 working days, if an AR is not able to provide ~160 hours of output then the following strategy can be done to fill in the gap:<ol><li>Provide a similarly competent and capable <strong>substitute</strong> to do the ARs work in their absence</li><li>Fill in the missing output by providing <strong>other output</strong> (like testing, graphic design, IM, etc)</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>What happens when an AR is on Leave for more than 2 days per month?<ol><li>The AR can make up for missing output the next month. </li></ol></li></ul><p>or</p><ul><li><ol><li><strong>Provide a substitute person</strong>: The PC needs to ensure that any pending work is explained to some other team member, before the person goes on a planned leave.

What helps a Rubico employee will help the Clients in the long run.</li><li>The AR should inform the Client when a Rubico event is scheduled and let the Client know how it will help the person grow and therefore the Client is benefited.</li></ol></li><li>How to manage expectations on previous projects an AR was involved in and work keeps coming?<ol><li>Sometimes tasks do come in from Clients we have worked with. There are 2 ways to handle the situation:<ol><li><strong>Approach 1 if tasks are less</strong> - The AR can spare some time and get the tasks done. In certain cases it may require the AR to work on Saturday or stay late/come in early.</li><li><strong>Approach 2 if tasks are more</strong> - The AR will do Knowledge Transfer (KT) to another person and the AR acts as a consultant/guide/mentor to the new resource.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Does my scope of learning get limited if I am an AR, as my scope is limited to one Client, project and framework?<ol><li>Team members should devote some time to learning and set aside a few hours of the week to learn a new technology or advancements in the same domain. This will keep them abreast with the changing technology world. Being an AR actually helps to carve time out for real learning and implement the same in projects for betterment, taking into confidence the Client.</li><li>ARs are expected to be consulting the Client and others in areas that can be improved by applying new technology and methods to achieve better effectiveness and efficiency. <ol><li>Note: Discuss your consultation first with the PC and team, before discussing with Client directly.</li></ol></li><li>If an AR is getting bored and desires to get exposure to a different type of technology or Client, then a request can be made to be changed to a half time AR to the PC and RM.</li></ol></li><li>How can an AR justify 8 hours of productivity, when the actual productive hours are around 6-7 hours in a day?<ol><li>An AR is expected to give output equal to a full time person. Some people are able to give full time output within 6-7 hours because they are experienced and work very fast. Others have to work 10+ hours per day in order to provide full time output because they lack experience and skill.</li><li>Throughout the project ARs are accepting tasks and making commitments on when they will deliver the tasks completed. It is important that ARs keep their commitments and work however many hours are necessary to deliver their tasks on time.</li></ol></li></ul><h2><a id="_1c4qfwjuq98h"></a>USA Team Management</h2><p>If a project requires a USA team member to be engaged (Marketing, Product Manager, etc.) the Project coordinator should request the creation of a project on Club under the name [Client Name] - [Project Name] - US, this is where the USA Team member will log their hours. </p><p>Hours logged by anyone in the US will be logged in a separate Club project than the hours logged by anyone in India, for billing purposes.
