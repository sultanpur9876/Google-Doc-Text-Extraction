Competency will always contain an element of subjectiveness, but it’s important to have an understanding of our team’s competency in various technologies so that we can make well-informed decisions. We have created the following 5-point competency scale:

- Level 1 (Learner) Learning the domain

- Level 2 (Contributor) Contributing to projects

- Level 3 (Problem Solver) Contributing independently

- Level 4 (Leader) Leading projects

- Level 5 (SME) Subject Matter Expert



Each of these levels are defined more in detail in the Purple Book.
